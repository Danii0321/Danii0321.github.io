    <p><strong>My name is Dani
      and I am a first year student at Northeastern University in Boston, Massachusetts.
      I chose Northeastern because I wanted to get an experiential education with
      opportunities to work within the field before graduation. I also appreciated
      the ease of combining Computer Science and Design into a single degree, as well as
      the variety and intensity of the courses.
      <br>
      <br>
      I have a lot of passion for what I do, from sketching new logo designs to finding
      the most efficient algorithm and everything in between.
      This website was created as a personal project following a semester of instruction,
      and was built entirely from scratch using HTML and CSS.
