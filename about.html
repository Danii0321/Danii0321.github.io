  <h2>What Do You Study?</h2>
  <p>
    Right now, I am in my fourth year at Northeastern University studying
    Computer Science and User Experience Design. I've taken courses specializing in
    human-computer interaction, software development, programming languages,
    computer systems, algorithms and computational theory. I have also taken classes
    focusing on the design process from ideation all the way to testing
    a final product with potential users. Some of the coolest electives I have taken have been
    on the history of graphic novels, the ethics of creating AI, and researching for game development.
    I love exploring new ways to combine art and technology.

  <h2>What Do You Create?</h2>
  <p>
    Every inch of this site was designed by me, from the paintings featured on
    the homepage to the code that created this text box. This site came to be because I
    wanted a personal website, but I just couldn't get what I wanted
    with all those darn templates! It made me wonder, hey, could I do this on
    my own?
    <br><br>
    I started out pretty small with a basic knowledge of HTML, then I picked
    up CSS and started to make this site look less like it was from the 90s. I built it
    up and tore it down and repeated the cycle until I had something working. Then, I set
    up the domain using GitHub to host all my pages and got this thing to go live!
    <br><br>
    Over the years I have built a foundation programming in Java, then I was
    able to learn Python and Javascript on the job at my first internship with
    Amazon Robotics. I have also done some creative coding and game development
    using Processing and Android Studio. If you'd like to see some more of
    my work, check out my Code page!

  <h2>Are You Currently Looking for an Internship?</h2>

    I am currently looking for a six month co-op
    position from July to December 2021. If you are interested in reaching out,
