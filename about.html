    <h2>What Did You Study?</h2>
    <p>
      I am a recent graduate from Northeastern University with a Bachelor's Degree in
      Computer Science and User Experience Design. I've taken courses specializing in
      human-computer interaction, software development, programming languages,
      computer systems, algorithms and computational theory. I have also taken classes
      focusing on the design process from ideation all the way to testing
      a final product with potential users. Some of the coolest electives I have taken have been
      on the history of graphic novels, the ethics of creating AI, and researching for game development.
      I love exploring new ways to combine art and technology.

    <h2>What Do You Create?</h2>
    <p>
      Every inch of this site was designed by me, from the paintings featured on
      the homepage to the code that created this text box. This site came to be because I
      wanted a personal website, but I just couldn't get what I wanted
      with all those darn templates! It made me wonder, hey, could I do this on
      my own?
      <br><br>
      I started out pretty small with a basic knowledge of HTML, then I picked
      up CSS and started to make this site look less like it was from the 90s. I built it
      up and tore it down and repeated the cycle until I had something working. Then, I set
      up the domain using GitHub to host all my pages and got this thing to go live!
      <br><br>
      Over the years I have built a foundation programming in Java, then I was
      able to learn Python and Javascript on the job at my first internship with
      Amazon Robotics. I have also done some creative coding and game development
      using Processing and Android Studio. If you'd like to see some more of
      my work, check out my Code page!

    <h2>Are You Currently Looking for an Internship?</h2>
    <p>
      I will be looking for a full time job after my graduation in May 2022!
